### Planning

I frist started with the game board and the event handlers. Making sure that when
you click on a square it console logs a success. Then I moved on to being able to
put an x or an o in the square, and for it to switch between them. Once that was
set I started on making sure you would not be able to then again to click on the
same square and change it's value. I start the game logic after that. Once all
logic was done and the game was working perfectly I moved to implementing the api.
