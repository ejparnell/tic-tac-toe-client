### Planning

I first started with the game board and the event handlers. Making sure that when
you click on a square it console logs a success. Then I moved on to being able to
put an x or an o in the square, and for it to switch between them. Once that was
set I started on making sure you would not be able to then again to click on the
same square and change it's value. I start the game logic after that. Once all
logic was done and the game was working perfectly I moved to implementing the api.

### Unsoleved bugges
I would like to clean up the code a lot more than what it is right now. Also being
able to finish games that have not ended would be fun to do.
